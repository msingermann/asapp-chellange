= ASAPP Coding Challenge - Chat

Coding challeng for ASAPP made with Springboot.

Decisions taken:

- move out of Spark as it is not updated since Nov 18, 2020 (https://github.com/perwendel/spark)
- Use Maven instead of Gradle. As i was starting the project from scratch i prefeer to use maven that i am more familiar with so i don't have to waste time dealing with gradle.



== Build And Run

Build jar with Maven wrapper

 ./mvn clean package

Build image with docker

 docker build -t app .

Run in docker

 docker run -p 8080:8080 app

Deploy in k8s
